<p>Snes9x for 3DS is a high-compatibility SNES emulator for your Old 3DS / 2DS. It runs many games at full speed (60 fps). It supports games that use CX4 chip (Megaman X2/X3), and the SDD-1 chip (Star Ocean, Super Street Fighter 2 Alpha). It can also play games that use the SuperFX chip (Yoshi's Island, etc), and the SA-1 chip (Super Mario RPG, Kirby's Dreamland, Kirby Super Star) but it runs slowly. It has generally much high compatibility than existing SNES emulators on the old 3DS because it uses Snes9x 1.43 as a base, and is a good alternative if your existing emulators cannot play all the games.</p>

<p>It also runs on your New 3DS, and it runs games faster! Use your New 3DS if you want to play SuperFX and SA-1 games!</p>

<a id="whats-supported" class="anchor" href="#whats-supported" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's supported</h2>

<ol>
<li>Graphic modes 0 - 7. </li>
<li>Save states of up to 4 slots</li>
<li>Cheats - place your .CHT/.CHX (text format) with the same filename in the same folder as your ROM. For example, if your ROM name is MyGame.smc, then your cheat file should be named MyGame.CHT or MyGame.CHX</li>
<li>Currently uses CSND for audio. So your entry point to home-brew must be able to use CSND. If you can play BlargSNES with sound, you should be able to play Snes9X_3DS with sound.</li>
<li>Frame skipping.</li>
<li>Stretch to full screen / 4:3 ratio </li>
<li>PAL (50fps) / NTSC (60 fps) frame rates.</li>
<li>Navigation of ROMs in different folders.</li>
<li>SDD1 chip (Street Fighter 2 Alpha, Star Ocean)</li>
<li>SFX1/2 chip (Yoshi's Island, but slow on old 3DS)</li>
<li>CX4 chip (Megaman X-2, Megaman X-3)</li>
<li>DSP chips (Super Mario Kart, Ace o Nerae)</li>
<li>SA-1 chip (Super Mario RPG, Kirby Superstar)</li>
<li>Use of full clock speed in the New 3DS.</li>
<li>Sound emulation (at 32KHz, with echo and interpolation)</li>
</ol>

<a id="whats-missing--needs-to-be-improved" class="anchor" href="#whats-missing--needs-to-be-improved" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's missing / needs to be improved</h2>

<ol>
<li>Minor sound emulation errors.</li>
<li>Mosaics.</li>
<li>In-frame palette changes - This is because this emulator uses the 3DS GPU for all graphic rendering. Without in-frame palette changes implemented, a small number of games experience colour issues.</li>
<li>Sprite layering issues.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="change-history" class="anchor" href="#change-history" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Change History</h2>

<p>v1.10</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented SA-1 sleep speed-hacks on the following games. These games run faster and some are able to run at 60 fps on the Old 3DS when things on-screen aren't too busy.
  <ul>
   <li>Super Mario RPG; Kirby’s Dreamland; Jikkyou Oshaberi Parodius; Kirby Super Star; Marvelous; Super Robot Taisen;</li>
   <li>Panic Bomber World; Dragon Ball Hyper Dimension; SD Gundam Next; Power Rangers Zeo;</li>
   <li>Daisenryaku Expert 2; Masters New Augusta 3; Bass Fishing; J96 Dream Stadium;</li>
   <li>Shining Scorpion; Pebble Beach New; PGA European Tour; SD F1 Grand Prix;</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed mode 7’s CLIP_10_BIT_SIGNED formula to use the original Snes9x’s formula. This fixes Super Chase HQ’s mode 7 intro.</li>
<li>Imported SPC7110 decompressor chip code from Snes9x 1.52. Now Tengai Makyou Zero (Far East of Eden Zero) can boot after 2 restarts, and in-game graphics appears without problems. </li>
<li>Fixed important bug in cheat engine so that it doesn't not increment the 65816 processor's clock cycles when enabling/disabling cheats.</li>
<li>Fixed the problem of the menu not using the correct font when the emulator first boots up.</li>
<li>Added one more mode when using the 3D slider for a sharper image.</li>
<li>Major refactoring of code.</li>
<li>Fixed SA1 MMC's memory map code by copying it from Snes9x 1.54.2. Now Super Mario World hack VLDC 9 boots.</li>
<li>Fixed Mode 0 rendering bug. The original bug was there since day 1 and with this fix, Lagoon's title screen looks right.</li>
</ul>

<p>v1.00</p>
<ul>
<li>Transplanted the full SPC700 + DSP source codes from Snes9x v1.51 into this emulator. As a result, the sound emulation now supports Gaussian Interpolation, and has better accuracy. This fixes some sound problems in Clay Fighter and Mortal Kombat I and II.</li>
<li>Fixed Mode 7 priorities in games that use this: Contra III's stage 1 (at the loss of some color fidelity). Implementing this required the use of some crazy math hacks and hardware tricks to pull this off.</li>
<li>Implemented some experimental speed hacks for Super Mario RPG and Kirby's Dreamland. Runs slightly faster (still not full speed) on Old 3DS.</li>
<li>Implemented hi-res translucency. We get non-flickering emulation of hi-res screens (Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 3, A.S.P. Air Strike Patrol) now as a bonus. As a result, Kirby's Dreamland is now playable.</li>
<li>Invented a new cheat file format .CHX (text file) so that players can add cheats by using any text editor.</li>
<li>Centralized the SNES output screen vertically on the top screen.</li>
<li>Overhauled the user interface to give a more modern look as well as provide additional fonts.</li>
<li>Added more screen stretch options as requested by many users.</li>
<li>Added 3D slider support. Pushing up the 3D slider doesn't create any 3D effect, but may create a better viewing experience.</li>
<li>Removed unnecessary debug messages during start up / shut down of the emulator.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug when the SRAM still saves randomly when it is set to Disabled.</li>
<li>Reduced memory footprint for storing texture position caches.</li>
<li>Made this version buildable with libctru v1.2.0 (thanks to Maki-chan) </li>
  [Note: Building with devkitARM r46 and libctru v1.2.0 will cause a bug where the emulator cannot utilize the full clock speed of the New 3DS.]</li>
</ul>

<p>v0.80</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed NMI interrupt for specific games such as Cu-On-Pa. This allows Cu-On-Pa to get past the selection screen.</li>
<li>Fixed ROM size calculation for Wonder Project J (English Patch). The game no longer hangs at the menu.</li>
<li>Implemented optimized rendering for offset-per-tile modes. This gives many games a major performance boost. Games such as Strike Gunner STG, Tetris Attack, Kirby's Avalanche, Contra's Stage 1 Boss, Super Mario All-Stars' Super Mario 2 all benefit from this improvement.</li>
<li>Implemented optimized rendering for sprites for modest performance boost.</li>
<li>Used SPC700 core from Snes9x v1.51.</li>
<li>Re-implemented an moderately optimized SA-1 core. Now games like Kirby Super Star, Super Mario RPG can boot. It will NOT run well on the old 3DS currently, but it will run smooth on a new 3DS with full clock speed.</li>
</ul>

<p>v0.70</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed sprites priority issues. This fixes sprites problems of Shadowrun, Chrono Trigger, Super Mario All Stars' (and possibly other games too)</li>
<li>The newly implemented rendering engine also provides some modest speed improvements in some games.</li>
<li>Added feature to save the directory of the previously loaded ROM.</li>
</ul>          
          
<p>v0.63</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in DMA when the source address comes from Save RAM. This fixes a number of Super Mario World Hacks so that text is readable on BG layer 3.</li>
<li>Fixed menu key lock issue to improve usability when exiting from menu back into the game.</li>
<li>Fixed DKC tile corruption issue. This probably also fixes most (if not all) tile corruption issues in other games, if you play a game for too long in a single sitting.</li>
<li>Fixed sound problems when auto-saving SRAM. Somehow the hardware or the library doesn't like us stopping and starting the CSND too often. Not too sure what the problem is.</li>
<li>Added an auto-save SRAM option to tell the emulator when to save SRAM (1 second, 10 seconds, 60 seconds, or disable auto-save).
Note that regardless of the setting, the emulator will always save any modified SRAM every time you touch the bottom screen to activate the menu. </li>
</ul>
          
<p>v0.62</p>
        
<ul>
<li>Improved Mode 7 zoomed-in textures. Games like Seiken Densetsu, ActRaiser 1/2 look better when viewing the Mode 7 textures near to the ground.</li>
<li>Improved sound handling to ensure that the left speaker plays at the same volume as the right speaker.</li>
<li>Added option to change in-frame palette handling. There are three options to choose from: 
   > Enabled. (Slow, accurate, but never as accurate as software) 
   >  Disabled Style 1 (faster, less accurate)
   > Disabled Style 2 (faster, less accurate) works a little differently from Style 1 
  Most games are by default Disabled Style 2. 
  Bahamut Lagoon and Front Mission Gun Hazard are by default Disabled Style 1. 
  Wild Guns, Judge Dredd, Batman Forever are by default Enabled.</li>
  <li>Fixed Clock Tower to boot properly again.</li>
<li>Fixed Star Fox flickering problem when there are frameskips.</li>
<li>Fixed outside-of-track texture problem with Super Mario Kart’s Bowser Castle stages.</li>
<li>Fixed Final Fantasy V Intro logo cutout problem.</li>
<li>Fixed Donkey Kong Country's tile colour corruption bug          </li>
</ul>
  
<p>v0.61</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed DSP bug that causes some games like Dragon Ball - Super Budoten 3, Umihara Kawase to mute.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that doesn't stop sound from playing when saving to SRAM.</li>
<li>Added option to hide FPS and unnecessary text from bottom screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>v0.6</p>

<ul>
<li>Default sound amplification to 2x  …</li>
<li>Reduced GPU freezing problem after loading new ROMs / resetting too many times</li>
<li>Resynchronise sound when you go into the menu (you can reset the sync this way after waking your 
3DS from sleep mode)</li>
<li>Improved sound sample rate to 32 KHz, and added echo and interpolation. The result is overall 
better sound quality</li>
<li>Improved sync between SPC700 emulation and the DSP.</li>
<li>Fixed Contra III Mode 7 EXTBG colors again.</li>
<li>Enabled the SPC700 Envelope Height reading.</li>
<li>Fixed Chrono Trigger music not resuming after any battle music or “sealed by mysterious force” music.</li>
</ul>

<p>v0.51</p>

<ul>
<li>Implemented pseudo hi-res mode 5 using alternate frame flickering to achieve the pseudo hi-res mode. 
Games that use this mode include: Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 3, Air Strike Patrol, and a number of others.</li>
</ul>

<p>v0.5</p>

<ul>
<li>Implemented major graphic rendering optimizations for color handling, transparency and window effects.
Although codes from BlargSNES was not used directly, ideas came from BlargSNES.
Some games that use windowing effects should see some / significant performance increase.
F-Zero (US / EUR versions) run full speed.
Super Mario Kart (EUR) runs full speed.
Axelay (US) runs at a playable speed.
Breath of Fire 2 battle transition effects are smooth.
Super Mario World circular window fade-in/out effects are smooth.
etc.</li>
<li>Fixed sprite flickering problems in Yoshi's Island and DKC2.</li>
<li>Fixed 256-color background problems. DKC1/2 and Earthworm Jim 2 intro shows up correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed Mode 7 BG2 problems. Now Super Star Wars - Empire Strikes Back (snowspeeder stage) works correctly.</li>
</ul>

<p>v0.42</p>

<ul>
<li>Minor optimisation to GPU drawing</li>
<li>Increased maximum number of cheats to 200.</li>
<li>Fix the crashing problem if there are too many cheats in the .CHT file.</li>
<li>Fixed the too many sprites on screen problem (fixes Shadowrun freezing)</li>
</ul>

<p>v0.41</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed some transparency issues with Saturday Night Slam Master and Ghost Chaser Densei.</li>
<li>Updated SRAM saving timing.</li>
<li>Minor optimisation for SuperFX emulation.</li>
<li>First implementation of speed hacks (experimental for F-Zero, Axelay,
Super Mario Kart, Yoshi’s Island)</li>
<li>Modified some debugging stuff.</li>
<li>Fixed some mode 7 glitches when a mode 7 game (like Super Mario Kart has been running for more than a few minutes)</li>
<li>Implemented palette flickering hack for Front Mission Gun Hazard, Bahamut Lagoon.</li>
<li>Implemented hack for Power Rangers Fighting Edition to prevent graphical glitches</li>
<li>Implemented hack for delayed SRAM (per 1 minute) saving for Star Ocean</li>
<li>Fixed the problem of loading up too many different ROMs once after another, causing the loading to finally fail.</li>
<li>When loading a game without settings, reset the frame rate setting to be based on the game's region.</li>
</ul>

<p>v0.4</p>

<ul>
<li>Experimental cheat feature. Requires you to have the .CHT file
(May corrupt your save game, use at your own risk)</li>
<li>Added settings to enable turbo buttons (per game)</li>
<li>Added settings to allow user to amplify volume (per game)
(beware of sound clipping that results in terrible sounds)</li>
<li>Palette hack for Secret of Mana to ensure that the dialog borders are blue 
(the bottom status window still behaves oddly due to palette changes)</li>
<li>Transparency fixes:
o Legend of Zelda's prologue's dark room
o Reported dark tints on several games like Doremi Fantasy, Bomberman, Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger

(eg. in NHL's EA Sports intro screen)</li>
<li>Added speed hack for games that use the WAI instruction 
(esp Donkey Kong Country 1, 2, 3 should see a good speed increase)</li>
<li>Added hack to avoid hiding sprites even if they exceed the maximum number the real hardware can display.
Apparently, this fixes the missing cursor in Final Fantasy III.</li>
<li>And other bugs.</li>
</ul>

<p>v0.35</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed Super Mario Kart grass area texture outside of the track. 
This fix should work for all cases.</li>
<li>Some minor performance and UI adjustments</li>
